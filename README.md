# TraceVisualizer

A tool for visualization of execution traces of [P] (https://github.com/p-org/P) and [PSharp] (https://github.com/p-org/PSharp) runtime. The tool converts traces into an input format (aka log) for the [ShiViz tool] (https://bestchai.bitbucket.io/shiviz/) . The ShiViz visualization engine generates interactive communication graphs - similar to Message Sequence Charts (MSCs) - from the logs.
Graphical representation of the traces as MSCs can be used:
- for initial development of a program in P and PSharp
- for debugging a program, to facilitate examination of error traces generated by P and PSharp testing tools
