# TraceVisualizer

A tool for visualization of execution traces of P and runtime. The tool converts traces into an input format (aka log) for the ShiViz tool (https://bestchai.bitbucket.io/shiviz). The ShiViz visualization engine generates interactive communication graphs - similar to Message Sequence Charts (MSCs) - from the logs.
Graphical representation of the traces as MSCs can be used:
- for initial development of a program in P and PSharp
- for debugging a program, to facilitate examination of error traces generated by P and PSharp testing tools
